# Wiser - Decentralized Crypto Betting Platform

## Important Notes

- **Deployment Challenges:** Due to last-minute internet connectivity issues, we were unable to upload the correct screenshots showing the deployment and verification of our smart contracts on the Scroll Sepolia network. We apologize for this inconvenience and are working to rectify this as soon as possible.
- **Redstone VRF:** We initially planned to implement Redstone's VRF for enhanced randomness. However, after discussions with Redstone's co-founder and guidance from the Scroll community on Discord, we learned that the VRF is not yet production-ready. As a result, we opted for a pseudo-randomness approach.

## Hardhat Test Results

We take the reliability and integrity of our smart contracts seriously. To ensure our code meets the highest standards, we rigorously test using Hardhat combined with Chai and Mocha. Below is a screenshot of our latest test results, demonstrating the successful execution and passing of all tests:
